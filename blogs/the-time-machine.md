# The Time Machine

Everything is created with dimensions. 

The coordinate geometry of every verse.
point is the origin or building material of dimension. point has all same properties as zero.

## Properties of points
- Dimensionless: A point is dimensionless, meaning it does not have any length, width, or height.
- Position: A point determines the location or position in a plane11. Itâ€™s like a dot on a map representing a specific location.
- Intersection: When two lines intersect each other, they cross each other at a point known as the point of intersection.


point is 0th dimension or dimensionless. Being dimensionless it is capable of creating dimensions.

There is no spacing between points. space between them is perfect 0.
0th dimension = point => .
1st dimension = line (10 points) => . . . .
2nd dimension => square (4 x 4 points)

3rd dimension => 3rd cube => 
         .  .  .  .

Every living creature is capable of seeing only the 3rd dimensional object. The 0th, 1st, 4th and so on dimensions cannot be seen. These dimensions can only be drawn on paper.
