# The Time Machine

Every visible and invisible object possesses all dimensions that exist. This means that all dimensions apply to an object. **When I refer to a two-dimensional object, it is not that the object is strictly two-dimensional; rather, I am only considering its two-dimensional properties at that instance.** Everything that exists has all \( n \) number of dimensions attached to it.

It all begins with the **0th dimension**. Imagine an object with zero length, breadth, and height. It’s essentially nothing—a point in geometry. This point is the simplest form of space and serves as the building block for higher dimensions.

Let’s use simple math to construct a object. Lets create a Cube.

Combining **two 0th-dimensional** (points object) creates a **1st-dimensional object**—a line. \
Combining **four 1st-dimensional** (lines object) forms a **2nd-dimensional object**—a plane. \
Combining **six 2nd-dimensional** (planes object) results in a **3rd-dimensional object**—a space (which humans can perceive). 
- This pattern continues into higher dimensions.

There is no strict order for creating a line, then a plane, and then a space. I could also refer to the 3rd dimension as time and the 4th as space. However, for the sake of convention, let’s maintain this order. For example, in daily life, when building a wall, it doesn’t matter whether you first arrange all the bricks horizontally and then stack them vertically, or if you start by placing bricks vertically one above another and then continue horizontally—both methods will eventually give you a wall.

Simply:
**0th dimension**: A point. \
**2 × 0th dimension** = 1st dimension (a line) \
**4 × 1st dimension** = 2nd dimension (a plane)  
**6 × 2nd dimension** = 3rd dimension (a space, visible to humans) \
**8 × 3rd dimension** = 4th dimension (time) \
**10 × 4th dimension** = 5th dimension (string theory)

For now, let’s stop at the **4th dimension** and discuss **time**.

### Time: The Fourth Dimension
For our cube:
Its creation can be described as two points creating a line, four lines creating a face, and six faces creating a cube. However, a cube cannot exist if all dimensions are not applied to it. For now, let’s ignore other dimensions and focus on what happens if the fourth dimension is missing. Since the fourth dimension is time, imagine the cube we created is given a fourth dimension of 1 second. In this case, the cube would only exist for 1 second in our world before ceasing to exist. If we set the fourth dimension to 0, it would be as if the cube never existed at all. Something can be created with length, breadth, and height, but without time, its existence is equivalent to nothing. Each dimension is as important to the lower dimensions as the higher ones.

Understanding time is challenging, and thinking about dimensions above the fourth is a different topic for now. Let's focus up to the fourth dimension. As I mentioned at the start of my blog: `When I refer to a two-dimensional object, it is not that the object is strictly two-dimensional; rather, I am only considering its two-dimensional properties at that instance.` If any dimension is missing in an object, it is equivalent to the object having no dimensions at all—it never existed. It’s like an all-or-nothing scenario.

We will only focus up to the fourth dimension. So, we will consider our object to have a total of four dimensions. We are going to play with this cube object and conduct some thought experiments.

### Time Travel
Let's bring our cube into the XYZ world.
X is the 1st dimension,
Y is the 2nd dimension,
Z is the 3rd dimension.

In the XYZ world, the cube can travel along the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis. If it is possible to travel in all three dimensions, then it is also possible to travel in the 4th dimension. For a human, it is easy to imagine a cube traveling in the XYZ world. However, as we know, all dimensions are applied to the cube and the XYZ world simultaneously. As of now, we are considering the highest dimension to be the 4th.

Let's imagine how it will look to a human whose brain only supports seeing three dimensions at a time. How will it look to a human when the cube is traveling via the 4th dimension?

Let's first understand how the 2D world works. \
Carl Sagan, in his book "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" (though originally written by Edwin A. Abbott), describes a two-dimensional (2D) world to help us understand dimensions. Imagine a flat world, like a piece of paper, where everything exists only in two dimensions: length and width. There’s no concept of height or depth. The beings in this 2D world are flat shapes, like triangles, squares, and circles, and they can only move left, right, forward, or backward. They cannot look up or down because "up" and "down" don’t exist in their world.

In this 2D world, life is limited to the flat surface. If two shapes want to pass each other, they must move around one another on the plane. They can’t jump over or go under because those directions don’t exist for them. Their vision is also limited—they can only see the edges of objects, not the full shape. For example, if a 3D sphere passed through their world, they would only see a circle that appears, grows, and then shrinks as the sphere moves through their plane.

**What Happens If a 3D Object Passes Through 2D world:** \
If a three-dimensional (3D) object, like a sphere, passes through the 2D world, the flat beings would see something strange. As the sphere enters their plane, they would see a tiny dot that grows into a circle, reaches a maximum size, and then shrinks back to a dot before disappearing. To them, this would seem magical or impossible because they can’t perceive the third dimension. They wouldn’t understand that the circle is just a "slice" of a 3D object moving through their flat world.

Carl Sagan uses this idea to explain how we, as 3D beings, might struggle to understand higher dimensions (like the fourth dimension). Just as the 2D beings can’t fully grasp a 3D object, we might have a hard time imagining what a 4D object would look like.

It’s hard, but let’s still do it. For now, we will be using the same words as Carl Sagan. We already know how our 3D world exists, so no explanation is needed.

Let’s discuss taking everything from the above example and converting it for a higher dimension.

**What Happens If a 4D Object Passes Through a 3D World:** \
If a fourth-dimensional (4D) object, like a sphere, passes through the 3D world, human beings would see something strange. As the sphere enters their world, they would see a tiny dot that grows into a sphere—starting as a small sphere, then growing bigger, reaching a maximum size, and then shrinking back to a dot before disappearing.

For our cube, it would be seen as a tiny cube appearing. It might be so small that it initially appears as a tiny dot to a human. As it grows bigger, it becomes visible as a cube, continuing to grow until it reaches its maximum size. Then, it shrinks back into a smaller cube, eventually becoming a tiny dot again before disappearing.

If in your life you see any object appearing from nowhere and getting bigger in size, you should think it is traveling through time. Imagine if time stops, and no clock is moving, and an object is traveling from the future to the past. It would appear as if the object is emerging from nowhere. If it wants to stop at our current time and not go further into the past, it will reach its maximum size and not shrink. However, if it intends to go further into the past, it will keep shrinking and reappearing at another point in time.

From this, we can assume that if we want to create a time machine capable of sending an object into the past, we would need to shrink it—but not physically. Its mass would remain the same; it would be as if the object is shrinking in one instance of time and growing in another, and vice versa.

If this process happens as fast as the speed of light, the object would appear to be created in an instant. It would seem as though it never grew or shrank but simply appeared and disappeared. It would be like seeing an empty piece of land one moment and a multi-story building the next. However, in reality, there was a significant amount of time and a complex process involved in constructing the building on the land.


Extending this logic, 
```
                            
                      • • • • •     
                      • • • • •    
    •    • • • • •    • • • • •   
                      • • • • •   
                      • • • • •     
```
higher dimensions are created from lower dimensions. Just as similar dots create a line, and similar lines create a plane, our concept of time must have been created using layers of space. Therefore, when we travel through time, we are essentially traveling through layers of space. This means that every instance of time has its own corresponding space.

We are always moving through time, advancing into the future moment by moment. Each second, we enter a new, similar space. In this view, time is like layers of space stacked together. With every passing moment, we shift to a new space, a new world, or even a new universe. For every moment in time, there is a corresponding new space.

This is similar to how frames change in a video. In a video, there is a new image for every fraction of a second, creating the illusion of continuous motion. However, it is just a series of individual images rolling so fast that we perceive it as a seamless video. Similarly, time could be thought of as layers of space rolling continuously, giving us the illusion of a flowing, unified reality.


In our world, if I am standing on a flat surface, my x, y, and z axes will not change. However, if I am standing on a slope with no friction, I will keep sliding. Imagine an infinite slope, I would keep falling forever without doing anything. Perhaps this is similar to how time is created. Time could be like a slope; even if we are not doing anything, it keeps flowing, and the angle of the slope determines the speed of time.

If we are falling along the infinite slope of time, it means the slope is already in place, and all the layers of space that make up time already exist. This implies that everything that has happened and everything that will happen is already determined. We are simply moving through these pre-existing layers of space endlessly.

It is also possible that the future is written first, then the present, and then the past. We cannot determine the order in which they come into existence. It is like a highway—you don’t know where they started building it. It might have been created from the middle, the end, or even the start. Alternatively, the start, middle, and end could have been created simultaneously.

By default, we are all time travelers in the biggest time machine, one that takes us to new spaces every second, microsecond, or the smallest unit of time that exists.
