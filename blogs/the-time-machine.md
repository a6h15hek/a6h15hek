# The Time Machine

Every visible and invisible object possesses all dimensions that exist. This means that all dimensions apply to an object. **When I refer to a two-dimensional object, it is not that the object is strictly two-dimensional; rather, I am only considering its two-dimensional properties at that instance.** Everything that exists has all \( n \) number of dimensions attached to it.

It all begins with the **0th dimension**. Imagine an object with zero length, breadth, and height. It’s essentially nothing—a point in geometry. This point is the simplest form of space and serves as the building block for higher dimensions.

Let’s use simple math to construct a object. Lets create a Cube.

Combining **two 0th-dimensional** (points object) creates a **1st-dimensional object**—a line. \
Combining **four 1st-dimensional** (lines object) forms a **2nd-dimensional object**—a plane. \
Combining **six 2nd-dimensional** (planes object) results in a **3rd-dimensional object**—a space (which humans can perceive). \
- This pattern continues into higher dimensions.

There is no strict order for creating a line, then a plane, and then a space. I could also refer to the 3rd dimension as time and the 4th as space. However, for the sake of convention, let’s maintain this order. For example, in daily life, when building a wall, it doesn’t matter whether you first arrange all the bricks horizontally and then stack them vertically, or if you start by placing bricks vertically one above another and then continue horizontally—both methods will eventually give you a wall.

Simply:
**0th dimension**: A point. \
**2 × 0th dimension** = 1st dimension (a line) \
**4 × 1st dimension** = 2nd dimension (a plane)  
**6 × 2nd dimension** = 3rd dimension (a space, visible to humans) \
**8 × 3rd dimension** = 4th dimension (time) \
**10 × 4th dimension** = 5th dimension (string theory)

For now, let’s stop at the **4th dimension** and discuss **time**.

### Time: The Fourth Dimension
For our cube:
Its creation can be described as two points creating a line, four lines creating a face, and six faces creating a cube. However, a cube cannot exist if all dimensions are not applied to it. For now, let’s ignore other dimensions and focus on what happens if the fourth dimension is missing. Since the fourth dimension is time, imagine the cube we created is given a fourth dimension of 1 second. In this case, the cube would only exist for 1 second in our world before ceasing to exist. If we set the fourth dimension to 0, it would be as if the cube never existed at all. Something can be created with length, breadth, and height, but without time, its existence is equivalent to nothing. Each dimension is as important to the lower dimensions as the higher ones.

Understanding time is challenging, and thinking about dimensions above the fourth is a different topic for now. Let's focus up to the fourth dimension. As I mentioned at the start of my blog: `When I refer to a two-dimensional object, it is not that the object is strictly two-dimensional; rather, I am only considering its two-dimensional properties at that instance.` If any dimension is missing in an object, it is equivalent to the object having no dimensions at all—it never existed. It’s like an all-or-nothing scenario.

We will only focus up to the fourth dimension. So, we will consider our object to have a total of four dimensions. We are going to play with this cube object and conduct some thought experiments.

### Time Travel
Let's bring our cube into the XYZ world.
X is the 1st dimension,
Y is the 2nd dimension,
Z is the 3rd dimension.

In the XYZ world, the cube can travel along the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis. If it is possible to travel in all three dimensions, then it is also possible to travel in the 4th dimension. For a human, it is easy to imagine a cube traveling in the XYZ world. However, as we know, all dimensions are applied to the cube and the XYZ world simultaneously. As of now, we are considering the highest dimension to be the 4th.

Let's imagine how it will look to a human whose brain only supports seeing three dimensions at a time. How will it look to a human when the cube is traveling via the 4th dimension?

Let's first understand how the 2D world works. \
Carl Sagan, in his book "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" (though originally written by Edwin A. Abbott), describes a two-dimensional (2D) world to help us understand dimensions. Imagine a flat world, like a piece of paper, where everything exists only in two dimensions: length and width. There’s no concept of height or depth. The beings in this 2D world are flat shapes, like triangles, squares, and circles, and they can only move left, right, forward, or backward. They cannot look up or down because "up" and "down" don’t exist in their world.

In this 2D world, life is limited to the flat surface. If two shapes want to pass each other, they must move around one another on the plane. They can’t jump over or go under because those directions don’t exist for them. Their vision is also limited—they can only see the edges of objects, not the full shape. For example, if a 3D sphere passed through their world, they would only see a circle that appears, grows, and then shrinks as the sphere moves through their plane.

**What Happens If a 3D Object Passes Through 2D world:** \
If a three-dimensional (3D) object, like a sphere, passes through the 2D world, the flat beings would see something strange. As the sphere enters their plane, they would see a tiny dot that grows into a circle, reaches a maximum size, and then shrinks back to a dot before disappearing. To them, this would seem magical or impossible because they can’t perceive the third dimension. They wouldn’t understand that the circle is just a "slice" of a 3D object moving through their flat world.

Carl Sagan uses this idea to explain how we, as 3D beings, might struggle to understand higher dimensions (like the fourth dimension). Just as the 2D beings can’t fully grasp a 3D object, we might have a hard time imagining what a 4D object would look like. 

---

It’s hard, but let’s still do it. For now, we will be using the same words as Carl Sagan. We already know how our 3D world exists, so no explanation is needed.

Let’s discuss taking everything from the above example and converting it for a higher dimension.

**What Happens If a 4D Object Passes Through a 3D World:** \
If a fourth-dimensional (4D) object, like a sphere, passes through the 3D world, human beings would see something strange. As the sphere enters their world, they would see a tiny dot that grows into a sphere—starting as a small sphere, then growing bigger, reaching a maximum size, and then shrinking back to a dot before disappearing.

For our cube, it would be seen as a tiny cube appearing. It might be so small that it initially appears as a tiny dot to a human. As it grows bigger, it becomes visible as a cube, continuing to grow until it reaches its maximum size. Then, it shrinks back into a smaller cube, eventually becoming a tiny dot again before disappearing.

So if in your life if you see anything any object appearing from nowhere and getting bigger in size you can think maybe its traveling. Think of it if suppose our time stops and no clock is moving and a object is traveling from future to past it will appears as object apperaing from nowhere and if it want to stop at our time not go further in the past it will just reach to its maximum size and did not shrink. and if it want to go to further in the past it will keep shrinking and appearing in another time. So we can assume if we want to create a time machine that can send a object in the past then we have to shrink it but not physically. Its mass will be same, it will be like its shrinking in a instance of time and growing in another and vice versa. if it happens so fast as speed of light it can be seen as object got created in a instance. it will be seen like it never grow or shrink it just appeared. its like seeing a land when its empty and now there is multi stories building. But there was a huge time and process was there between creating building on land.

Extending this logic, we can also say that 
```
                            
                      • • • • •     
                      • • • • •    
    •    • • • • •    • • • • •   
                      • • • • •   
                      • • • • •     
```
like in this example similar dots create a line and similar lines create plane. Our time is created layer must have been created using space. Mean every instance of time have their own space. We always travel though time in future second by second. we can say that after every second we travel to a new similar space. time is made up of layers of space. After every every instance we travel to new space, new world, new universe. For every instance of time there is new space. 

In our world if i am standing on a plane surface, my x y z axis will not change but if i am standing on a slope and slope where there is no friction i will keep sliding. imagine a infinite slope then i will keep falling from it forever without doing anything. Maybe this is similar to our how the time is created its a slope, even if are not doing anything it keeps flowing and the angle of the slope decided how much will be the speed of time. 

if we are falling from the infinite slope of time then everything that is happened and everything that is going to happen is all written. As time is created from layers of spaces then all the spaces is already been created we are just moving through them infinitely.

Its a possibility also that the future is written first then the present aand then past. we cannot determine the order which comes first. its like a highway you don't know from where they started creating it, it might be created from middle  or at end and then start. or start end and middle at the same time. 

By default we are all time travels in biggest time machine. that takes to new spaces every second or micro second or any smallets unit of time that exists.
