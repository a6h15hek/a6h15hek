# The Time Machine

Every visible and invisible object possesses all dimensions that exist. This means that all dimensions apply to an object. **When I refer to a two-dimensional object, it is not that the object is strictly two-dimensional; rather, I am only considering its two-dimensional properties at that instance.** Everything that exists has all \( n \) number of dimensions attached to it.

It all begins with the **0th dimension**. Imagine an object with zero length, breadth, and height. It’s essentially nothing—a point in geometry. This point is the simplest form of space and serves as the building block for higher dimensions.

Let’s use simple math to construct a object. Lets create a Cube.

Combining **two 0th-dimensional** (points object) creates a **1st-dimensional object**—a line. \
Combining **four 1st-dimensional** (lines object) forms a **2nd-dimensional object**—a plane. \
Combining **six 2nd-dimensional** (planes object) results in a **3rd-dimensional object**—a space (which humans can perceive). \
- This pattern continues into higher dimensions.

There is no strict order for creating a line, then a plane, and then a space. I could also refer to the 3rd dimension as time and the 4th as space. However, for the sake of convention, let’s maintain this order. For example, in daily life, when building a wall, it doesn’t matter whether you first arrange all the bricks horizontally and then stack them vertically, or if you start by placing bricks vertically one above another and then continue horizontally—both methods will eventually give you a wall.

Simply:
**0th dimension**: A point. \
**2 × 0th dimension** = 1st dimension (a line) \
**4 × 1st dimension** = 2nd dimension (a plane)  
**6 × 2nd dimension** = 3rd dimension (a space, visible to humans) \
**8 × 3rd dimension** = 4th dimension (time) \
**10 × 4th dimension** = 5th dimension (string theory)

For now, let’s stop at the **4th dimension** and discuss **time**.

### Time: The Fourth Dimension
For our cube:
Its creation can be described as two points creating a line, four lines creating a face, and six faces creating a cube. However, a cube cannot exist if all dimensions are not applied to it. For now, let’s ignore other dimensions and focus on what happens if the fourth dimension is missing. Since the fourth dimension is time, imagine the cube we created is given a fourth dimension of 1 second. In this case, the cube would only exist for 1 second in our world before ceasing to exist. If we set the fourth dimension to 0, it would be as if the cube never existed at all. Something can be created with length, breadth, and height, but without time, its existence is equivalent to nothing. Each dimension is as important to the lower dimensions as the higher ones.

Understanding time is challenging, and thinking about dimensions above the fourth is a different topic for now. Let's focus up to the fourth dimension. As I mentioned at the start of my blog: `When I refer to a two-dimensional object, it is not that the object is strictly two-dimensional; rather, I am only considering its two-dimensional properties at that instance.` If any dimension is missing in an object, it is equivalent to the object having no dimensions at all—it never existed. It’s like an all-or-nothing scenario.

We will only focus up to the fourth dimension. So, we will consider our object to have a total of four dimensions. We are going to play with this cube object and conduct some thought experiments.
