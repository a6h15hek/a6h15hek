# The Time Machine

Every entity exists within the framework of dimensions.

The coordinate geometry of every verse is a testament to this. A point serves as the origin or the fundamental building block of dimensions. Interestingly, a point shares some properties with zero.

## Properties of points
- Dimensionless: A point is dimensionless, meaning it does not have any length, width, or height.
- Position: A point determines the location or position in a plane11. Itâ€™s like a dot on a map representing a specific location.
- Intersection: When two lines intersect each other, they cross each other at a point known as the point of intersection.


## Creating dimension with point
A point, being dimensionless or of the 0th dimension, is a fundamental concept in the creation of dimensions.
There is no spacing between points. The space between them is a perfect zero.

0th dimension = point => .
1st dimension = line (10 points) => . . . .
2nd dimension => square (4 x 4 points)
```
.  .  .  .
.  .  .  .
.  .  .  .
.  .  .  .
```


3rd dimension => 3rd cube => 
```
         .  .  .  .
      .  .  .  .  .
   .  .  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  .  .
.  .  .  .
```

Humans perceive the world in three spatial dimensions. The 0th, 1st, 4th, and so on dimensions are not directly observable in our everyday life. These dimensions can be represented mathematically or conceptually.

Every object, composed of dimensions, resides within larger dimensional spaces, and this pattern continues.

## The Time - 4th Dimension.

lets consider our planet earth is the biggest dimension. and lets call
1st dimension = x
2nd dimension = y
3rd dimension = z
4th dimension = t

Think of a cube that exists on the earth with above dimensions. 
x = length, y = width, z = height, t = time passed since it is created(seconds)
