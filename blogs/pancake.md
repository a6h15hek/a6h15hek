# Pancake Sync MyProjects

Tired of juggling multiple projects, remembering complex commands, and setting up development environments from scratch? Meet **Pancake**â€”a command-line tool designed to simplify your workflow, sync projects effortlessly, and make your developer life deliciously easy. 

---

## Why Pancake?  

As developers, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously. Each project has its own setup, build commands, and dependencies. Keeping track of everything can be a nightmare. Pancake solves this by:  

- **Centralizing project management**: Sync, build, and run projects with simple commands.  
- **Automating tool setup**: Install/update dev tools in one click.  
- **Simplifying migration**: Share your entire setup across machines with a single file.  
- **Reducing cognitive load**: No more memorizing long commands or setup steps.

## Key Features  

**Sync Projects from Remote Repos**  
Clone or update multiple projects in one go.  
**Build & Run Projects**  
Predefine build/run commands per projectâ€”execute them with a single line.  
**Tool Management**  
Install, update, or remove tools (e.g., `tree`, `npm`) effortlessly.  
**IDE Integration**  
Open projects directly in VS Code, IntelliJ, or your favorite editor.  
**Monitor Projects**  
Track ports, process IDs, and uptime for running applications.  
**Migrate Your Setup**  
Copy `pancake.yml` to another machine, run `pancake init`, and your entire environment is ready.

## Getting Started  

### Step 1: Initialize Pancake  
After installing, run:  
```bash  
pancake init  
```  
This creates `~/pancake.yml`â€”your central configuration file.  

### Step 2: Configure Your Projects  
Edit the config file:  
```bash  
pancake edit config  
```  
Add your projects like this:  
```yaml  
code_editor: code  # VS Code. Use 'idea' for IntelliJ.  

projects:  
  spring-boot:  
    remote_ssh_url: git@github.com:spring-guides/gs-spring-boot.git  
    run: cd gs-spring-boot/initial && mvn spring-boot:run  
    build: cd gs-spring-boot/initial && mvn clean install  

  react-app:  
    remote_ssh_url: git@github.com:your-username/react-app.git  
    type: web
    port: "3000"
    run: npm start  
    build: npm install  
```  

### Step 3: Sync Projects  
Sync all projects:  
```bash  
pancake sync  
```  
Or sync a specific project:  
```bash  
pancake sync react-app  
```  

### Step 4: Build, Run, and Monitor  
- **Open in IDE**: ```pancake open spring-boot```  
- **Build**: ```pancake build react-app```  
- **Run**: ```pancake run react-app```  
- **Monitor**: ```pancake monitor``` (shows running projects and ports)

## Tool Management  

Install tools with a single command:  
```bash  
pancake tool install tree      # Installs the 'tree' tool  
pancake tool upgrade nodejs    # Updates Node.js  
```  

Supports **Homebrew** (macOS/Linux) and **Chocolatey** (Windows).  

---

## Migrate Your Setup  

1. Copy `~/pancake.yml` to your new machine.  
2. Run:  
   ```bash  
   pancake init  
   ```  
3. Pancake syncs all projects and installs tools automatically. **Your setup is ready!**
