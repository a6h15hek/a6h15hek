# Pancake: Sync My Projects

Tired of juggling multiple projects, remembering complex commands, and setting up development environments from scratch? Meet **Pancake**â€”a command-line tool designed to simplify your workflow, sync projects effortlessly, and make your developer life deliciously easy. 


## Why Pancake?  

As developers, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously. Each project has its own setup, build commands, and dependencies. Keeping track of everything can be a nightmare. Pancake solves this by:  

- **Centralizing project management**: Sync, build, and run projects with simple commands.  
- **Automating tool setup**: Install/update dev tools in one click.  
- **Simplifying migration**: Share your entire setup across machines with a single file.  
- **Reducing cognitive load**: No more memorizing long commands or setup steps.  


## â˜… Key Features  

**- Effortless Project Syncing**  
Sync all your projects with a single command. Pancake clones or updates multiple repositories in one go, saving you from the hassle of manually managing each project. Perfect for developers juggling multiple codebases.  

**- One-Click Build & Run**  
Predefine build and run commands for each project, and execute them with a single line. Pancake eliminates the need to remember complex commands, letting you focus on coding instead of configuration.  

**- Seamless Tools Management**  
Install, update, or remove tools like `tree` or `npm` effortlessly. Pancake integrates with Homebrew (macOS/Linux) and Chocolatey (Windows), ensuring your dev tools are always up to date.  

**- IDE Integration Made Easy**  
Open projects directly in your favorite editorâ€”VS Code, IntelliJ, or othersâ€”with a single command. Pancake streamlines your workflow, making it easier to jump into coding without navigating folders manually.  

**- Real-Time Project Monitoring**  
Track ports, process IDs, and uptime for all your running applications. Pancakeâ€™s monitoring feature keeps you informed about the status of your projects, so you never lose sight of whatâ€™s running.  

**- Instant Environment Migration**  
Migrate your entire development setup in seconds. Simply copy your `pancake.yml` file to a new machine, run `pancake init`, and Pancake syncs your projects and tools automatically. Perfect for switching devices or onboarding new team members.

## âŠ¿ Getting Started  

### Step 1 - Initialize Pancake  
After installing, run:

### Step 2 - Configure Your Projects  
Edit the config file:  
```bash  
pancake edit config  
```  
Add your projects like this:  
```yaml  
code_editor: code  # VS Code. Use 'idea' for IntelliJ.  

projects:  
  spring-boot:  
    remote_ssh_url: git@github.com:spring-guides/gs-spring-boot.git  
    run: cd gs-spring-boot/initial && mvn spring-boot:run  
    build: cd gs-spring-boot/initial && mvn clean install  

  react-app:  
    remote_ssh_url: git@github.com:your-username/react-app.git  
    type: web
    port: "3000"
    run: npm start  
    build: npm install  
```  

### Step 3 - Sync Projects  
Sync all projects:  
```bash  
pancake sync  
```  
Or sync a specific project:  
```bash  
pancake sync react-app  
```  

### Step 4 - Build, Run, and Monitor  
- **Open in IDE**: ```pancake open spring-boot```  
- **Build**: ```pancake build react-app```  
- **Run**: ```pancake run react-app```  
- **Monitor**: ```pancake monitor``` (shows running projects and ports)  


## â›¯ Tool Management  

Install tools with a single command:  
```bash  
pancake tool install tree      # Installs the 'tree' tool  
pancake tool upgrade nodejs    # Updates Node.js  
```  

Supports **Homebrew** (macOS/Linux) and **Chocolatey** (Windows).  


## â–¶ Migrate Your Setup
